Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Overview: Amazon VPC allows you to create a logically isolated network within the AWS cloud.
Performance Features:
Elastic Network Interfaces: Supports high throughput and low latency with the option to create multiple network interfaces for different types of access.
Network ACLs and Security Groups: Fine-grained control over traffic that can enhance security while maintaining performance.
Scalability: Easily scale your VPC and subnets based on your workload requirements.
Use Cases: Suitable for hosting applications that require secure and isolated networking environments.
2. AWS Direct Connect
Overview: AWS Direct Connect is a service that establishes a dedicated network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS.
Performance Features:
Reduced Latency: Provides consistent, low-latency performance compared to traditional Internet connections.
High Bandwidth: Can handle high-bandwidth applications, supporting up to 100 Gbps.
Scalability: Allows you to scale your bandwidth as needed without routing through the public Internet.
Use Cases: Ideal for hybrid cloud setups, large data transfers, and applications sensitive to latency.
3. Amazon CloudFront
Overview: Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches content in edge locations globally.
Performance Features:
Low Latency: Brings content closer to end-users, reducing latency for global audiences.
Dynamic and Static Content: Optimally handles various web content types, including APIs, videos, and HTML.
Scalability: Automatically scales to meet traffic demands without additional configuration.
Use Cases: Best for serving websites, streaming media, or delivering APIs to users around the world.
4. AWS Global Accelerator
Overview: AWS Global Accelerator improves the availability and performance of your applications with users globally by routing traffic optimally.
Performance Features:
Static IP Addresses: Provides two static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application, regardless of your underlying infrastructure.
Optimal Routing: Uses the AWS global network to route traffic to your applications, reducing latency.
Scalability: Automatically adjusts traffic based on the health of the resources and their capacity.
Use Cases: Suitable for latency-sensitive applications that require high availability across multiple regions.
5. Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
Overview: ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses.
Performance Features:
High Availability: Distributes traffic across multiple availability zones to improve fault tolerance.
Dynamic Scaling: Integrates with Auto Scaling to automatically add or remove instances based on traffic patterns.
Scalability: Provides a scalable infrastructure for handling sudden traffic spikes.
Use Cases: Effective for web applications and backend services needing to manage variable loads.
6. Amazon Route 53
Overview: Route 53 is a scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service designed to route end-user requests to infrastructure running in AWS.
Performance Features:
Latency-Based Routing: Routes user requests to the nearest AWS region, minimizing latency.
Geo DNS: Directs traffic based on geographic location of users.
Scalability: Automatically scales to meet the demands of your application without any manual intervention.
Use Cases: Ideal for applications with global audiences needing optimized routing based on user location.
7. AWS Transit Gateway
Overview: AWS Transit Gateway connects multiple VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub.
Performance Features:
Efficient Traffic Management: Facilitates high bandwidth, low-latency transfer of data between VPCs and on-premises locations.
Public and Private Connectivity: Supports creating connections across different AWS regions.
Scalability: Allows easy scaling of multiple VPCs and on-premises networks without complex peering relationships.
Use Cases: Suitable for large organizations with multiple VPCs and on-premises networks needing centralized management and connectivity.
8. AWS PrivateLink
Overview: AWS PrivateLink allows you to securely access services hosted on AWS, such as S3, EC2, and third-party SaaS applications without exposing your traffic to the public internet.
Performance Features:
Low Latency: Provides secure access to services with low latency through private connectivity.
Private IP Connectivity: Keeps network traffic within the AWS backbone.
Scalability: Enables you to scale services securely without public internet exposure.
Use Cases: Ideal for accessing services that require high security and low-latency connections.
