Designing highly available and fault-tolerant architectures in AWS is crucial to ensure that applications can withstand outages and remain operational even in the face of component failures. Below are key strategies and AWS services that can be utilized to achieve high availability and fault tolerance.

1. Use Multiple Availability Zones (AZs)
AWS Regions & Availability Zones:

AWS Regions contain multiple Availability Zones. Distributing resources across multiple AZs ensures that if one zone fails, the others can handle the load.
Example: Deploy Amazon EC2 instances in at least two Availability Zones. Use an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic across these instances.

2. Load Balancers
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):

Use ELB to distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets, ensuring that if one instance goes down, traffic can be routed to another healthy instance.
Health Checks:

Configure health checks in ELB to monitor the health of instances and automatically remove unhealthy instances from the pool.
3. Autoscaling
Auto Scaling Groups:

Implement Auto Scaling to adjust the number of instances in response to traffic. This ensures that your application can handle spikes in load and can recover automatically if instances fail.
Scaling Policies:

Define policies for scaling out (adding instances) and scaling in (removing instances) based on CloudWatch metrics.
4. Data Storage and Replication
Amazon RDS:

Use Multi-AZ deployments for Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service). This automatically creates a synchronous standby replica in another AZ, providing failover capabilities.
Amazon S3:

Store static assets or backups in Amazon S3, which is inherently designed for high durability and availability. Use S3 Versioning and Cross-Region Replication for added redundancy.
Amazon DynamoDB:

Use DynamoDB with global tables for multi-region, fully replicated tables if you need to ensure low-latency access and disaster recovery.
5. Error Recovery and Backups
Backup Solutions:

Implement automated backups using AWS Backup or the native backup features within Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, and EC2.
SnapShots:

Take regular EBS snapshots for storage volumes to restore the state in case of failure.
6. Cross-Region Setup
Multi-Region Architectures:
For maximum resilience, consider deploying applications across multiple AWS regions. Use Route 53 for DNS routing to failover services in case of regional outages.
7. Decoupling Components
Microservices Architecture:
Decouple application components using Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service), Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service), or AWS Lambda. This minimizes cascade failures as components do not need to directly depend on each other.
8. Monitoring and Alarming
AWS CloudWatch:

Set up monitoring and alarms using Amazon CloudWatch to track the performance of your applications and receive alerts for potential issues.
AWS CloudTrail:

Use CloudTrail for auditing AWS API calls to track changes and potential misconfigurations.
9. Content Delivery and Caching
Amazon CloudFront:

Use CloudFront as a CDN to cache content at edge locations, improving availability and reducing latency for users globally.
AWS Global Accelerator:

Direct traffic to optimal endpoints using Global Accelerator, which improves availability by routing traffic to the nearest healthy endpoint.
Example Scenario: A Highly Available Web Application
Architecture Components:

Frontend:

Host the static website files in Amazon S3 and distribute them through Amazon CloudFront.
Application Layer:

Deploy the web application on Amazon EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling group distributed across multiple AZs, balanced with an ELB.
Database Layer:

Use Amazon RDS in a Multi-AZ setup for database storage, automated backups enabled, and read replicas if there is a need to scale read operations.
Networking:

Set up the VPC with public and private subnets. Place the load balancer in the public subnet and application instances in private subnets.
