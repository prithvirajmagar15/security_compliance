Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Pricing Tiers:

S3 Standard: Best for frequently accessed data.
S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Automatically moves data between two access tiers when access patterns change, optimizing for cost.
S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access): Lower-cost option for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed.
S3 One Zone-IA: Similar to Standard-IA but stored in a single Availability Zone, at a reduced cost.
S3 Glacier: Low-cost archival storage for data that is rarely accessed.
Cost-Effectiveness:

S3 is cost-effective for large volumes of data due to its tiered pricing.
You can use lifecycle policies to automatically transition objects between tiers based on access patterns.
2. Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
Pricing Options:

General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3): Balanced price and performance for a wide variety of workloads, including boot volumes and small to medium-sized databases.
Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2): Higher performance for critical applications, although this is more expensive.
Magnetic Volumes (Standard): SSD volumes are cheaper and good for infrequent access workloads.
Cost-Effectiveness:

Use gp3 volumes for a scalable option that allows you to provision IOPS independent of storage size, improving cost efficiency.
Snapshots can be used for backup and are charged based on the amount of data stored, providing a cost-effective way to manage backups.
3. Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
Pricing Plans:

EFS Standard: Good for frequently accessed files.
EFS Infrequent Access: Lower-cost option for files that are accessed less often but still need to be available.
Cost-Effectiveness:

EFS is an excellent choice for shared file storage with lower costs for infrequent access data, especially for applications that require a file system interface.
4. Amazon FSx
Cost-Effective Solutions:

FSx for Windows File Server: For Windows-based applications needing shared storage.
FSx for Lustre: Designed for high-performance workloads, but also has cost-effective pricing options based on usage.
Cost-Effectiveness:

Use FSx solutions that align with your performance needs and budget, ensuring efficient data processing and cost savings.
5. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive
Overview:

Specifically aimed at archival storage solutions for data that is rarely accessed (e.g., compliance data, backups).
Cost-Effectiveness:

This is one of the most cost-effective storage options in AWS, with extremely low retrieval costs and storage fees, ideal for long-term data retention.
6. AWS Snowball and Snowmobile
Overview:

Physical data transport solutions that allow you to transfer large quantities of data into and out of AWS.
Cost-Effectiveness:

Cost-effective for transferring exabytes of data, reducing the need for extensive bandwidth and potentially high transfer costs in other solutions.
7. AWS Storage Gateway
Overview:

A hybrid cloud storage solution that enables on-premises applications to use AWS cloud storage seamlessly.
Cost-Effectiveness:

Use this to transition to cloud storage gradually while leveraging cheaper on-premises storage with the benefit of AWS features.
8. CloudFormation and Auto-Scaling:
Cost-Effective Management:

Use AWS CloudFormation templates to automatically manage your resources and optimize your storage configuration.
Dynamic Scaling:

Use auto-scaling features to scale your storage costs to match demand, ensuring you are not over-provisioning and incurring unnecessary costs.
